# RADiQL 

RADiQL is a unique No Code / Low Code (NCLC) platform that, within minutes, fuses timeless machine-readable commercial, market, technical, process, workflow, architectural and organizational knowledge with concise and descriptive Semantic system specifications to directly synthesize highly optimised, model-driven, highly efficient executable Enterprise services and applications. And all in record time: minutes rather than years.

Amongst other possibilities, RADiQL can be used to build sophisticated model-driven and content-driven applications and services in an integrated, multi-tenant, modular Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. This platform can host web applications, installable progressive web applications (PWAs)for mobile and desktop and more.

# RADiQL Values

- Focus on business outcomes rather than software development, management overhead, development processes, fads and what would look good on a developer's resume.
- Low up front capital investment
- Low commercial risk
- Rapid return on investment
- Automated translation and internationalization (i18n) of software for maximum audience
- Ideal for production software as well as proofs of concept (POCs) and pilot systems
= Retention and publication of software specifications as a knowledge graph in a non-proprietary, open standard format (RDF).

# RADiQL Pillars of Success

1. The primary focus of RADiQL is on the creation and hyper-agile, rapid iteration of holistic business system requirements in a machine readable format, using Semantic Web Technologies.
3. Rapid production, delivery and deployment of software and documentation, almost entirely via automated code generation, automated documentation generation and AI-driven automation.
4. Delivery of highly performant, highly efficient, highly secure and optimised software for on-prem, edge, cloud, desktop, mobile platforms and IoT devices.
5. Elevated compute density and capacity to flex infrastructure, incredibly fast cold startup times, low energy consumption, green software implementation, with with state-of-the-art technologies such as the Rust programming language, WebAssembly (WASM) and highly portable WebAssembly runtimes.


# RADiQL Knowledge

In RADiQL we leverage what we and others already know about the problem space and the solution space to build the specifications for our application services quickly, reliably and in a manner that is easy to integrate these with other systems.

- Domain Knowledge
- Proprietary Knowledge
- Enterprise data
- Enterprise business rules
- Application business rules
- UI Features and paradigms

We create our specifications quickly and precisely based upon prior art, retained business knowledge, existing and reusable specifications and specification fragments. We use AI and knowledge graph queries to very quicly find, combine, refine augment this knowledge to produce and rapidly iterate and evolve our specifications.


- Reusable and sharable domain knowledge from public domain sources: vertical market, legal jursidiction, standards bodies, social knowledge graphs, etc.
- Reusable proprietary knowledge: valuable/confidential information and specialist knowledge within the enterprise that provide competitive advantage
- Reusable specifications for business data where each data item has well-defined semantic meaning, significance and relationships. This is highly enriched metadata in a queryable knowledge graph rather than merely a name and data format as in a typical database schema.
- Reusable specifications for business rules and functional behaviour to be exhibited by systems, applications and services.

All of the above are fused into a modular, machine-readable unified knowledge graph. In RADiQL we work with re-usable, flexible and extensible machine-readable knowledge and specifications that are "timeless" and long-lasting.



# What is RADiQL?

These are the key components of RADiQL

A highly extensible knowledge base containing knowledge about data, processes, workflows, organizations, business relationships, products solutions, applications and services. 
A solution requirements authoring and management
A code generation engine using advanced templating and binary code generation techniques.






Knowledge is held in machine-readable RDF format, using open standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
